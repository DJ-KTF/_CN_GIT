// Let’s create an alarm.

// Create a key called weekendAlarm,

// Create a variable called day and one called alarm.
// If day is Saturday or Sunday, set alarm to weekendAlarm.

// MY ALARM PROGRAM
let day = "Saturday";
let weekday = "Monday"; "Tuesday"; "Wednesday"; "Thursday", "Friday"
const alarm = "Wake Up Duncan!";

const alarmClock = {
  weekendAlarm: "No Alarm Needed",     // <-- key:value
  weekdayAlarm: "Get up at 7am",
};

if (day == "Saturday" || day == "Sunday"){
  console.log (alarmClock.weekendAlarm);
 (day == weekday);
  console.log (alarmClock.weekdayAlarm);
};
