// Activity 1: 
// Create a variable called age. 
// Write an if statement that logs “Yes I can serve you” 
// if the age is greater than 17 and else logs “You aren’t old enough”.

// Stretch:
// Take your if statement and add a variable called country in.
// Eg. if age > 17 and country == “UK”.

let age = 18
let country = "UK"
if (age == 17 || age > 17 && country == "UK") {
  console.log ("Yes, I Can Serve You!")
}
else {
  console.log ("You Are Not Old Enough!")
}

//  I could make this more robust by adding another Else If
